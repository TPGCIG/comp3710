Practical 1, Part 2:
I spent far too long trying to generate another fractal on the permitted list but it eventually always ended out not working due to:
    1. Me not understanding how it works, and
    2. Gen AI not understanding either.

Eventually ended up doing the dendrite Julia Set (by curiosity) but it ended out being extremely simple and similar to the original Julia set to implement (unknowingly so).

I can substantiate how the lines work but just want to iterate that this set is on the list and I understand how to generate fractals due to reading the code.

GenAI prompts:
*Can you explain every line of code in these Fractal generators &lt INSERT BOTH SETS OF CODE FROM THE MANDELBROT AND JULIA SET CONSTRUCTIONS &gt*

*how are the equations for the mandelbrot and julia sets converted mathematically to code*
